# Logistic-Regression 
# PROJECT TITLE : To predict the heart disease for oraganization "who",using machine learning alogorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing or decreasing manner.
 # PROBLEM STATEMENT :A "world health organization" estimated 12 millons death records. One of them half of the death result is found in US. The research scholar point out the most relevant rist factor of heart attack as a data science engineer predict the over all risk using machine learning alogorithm is called as logistic regreession
TASK-1:Import the libraries which is required for prediction.  
TASK-2: Import the dataset using your workspac
TASK-3: Use a appropiate of sklearn library to train,test and split the datasets
TASK4-: Fit your values with arrange function using feature scale
TASK-5: Check yuor model accuracy and presication using confusing matrix.

conclusion:
According to the model analysis the logisticregression algorithm work successfully with 0.6 accuracy shows that building the model is successful
